# Contributing to Ferrous DI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Ferrous DI! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Code of Conduct

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure a welcoming environment for all contributors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70.0 or later (MSRV)
- Git
- Basic familiarity with dependency injection concepts

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ferrous-di.git
   cd ferrous-di
   ```

2. **Install Rust toolchain**
   ```bash
   rustup update
   rustup component add rustfmt clippy
   ```

3. **Run tests to ensure everything works**
   ```bash
   cargo test
   cargo bench --no-run
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Before Making Changes

1. **Check existing issues and PRs** to avoid duplicate work
2. **Create an issue** for major changes to discuss the approach
3. **Create a feature branch** from main:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Making Changes

1. **Write tests first** (TDD approach recommended)
2. **Implement your changes**
3. **Update documentation** including doc comments and README if needed
4. **Ensure all checks pass**:
   ```bash
   # Format code
   cargo fmt

   # Check for linting issues
   cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

   # Run all tests
   cargo test

   # Test with different feature combinations
   cargo test --no-default-features
   cargo test --all-features

   # Check documentation builds
   cargo doc --no-deps --document-private-items
   ```

### Performance Considerations

Ferrous DI prioritizes performance. When making changes:

1. **Run benchmarks** to check for regressions:
   ```bash
   cargo bench --features performance
   ```

2. **Performance requirements**:
   - Singleton resolution: <100ns baseline
   - No unnecessary allocations in hot paths
   - Thread-safe operations with minimal contention

3. **Profile changes** if they affect hot paths:
   ```bash
   # Using perf (Linux)
   perf record --call-graph=dwarf cargo bench
   perf report
   ```

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Categories

1. **Unit tests** (in `src/lib.rs`):
   - Test individual functions and methods
   - Focus on edge cases and error conditions

2. **Integration tests** (in `tests/`):
   - `tests/basics.rs` - Core functionality
   - `tests/circular.rs` - Circular dependency detection
   - `tests/scopes.rs` - Scoped lifetime behavior
   - `tests/advanced_features.rs` - Named services, metadata
   - `tests/disposal.rs` - Resource cleanup
   - `tests/multi.rs` - Multi-binding scenarios

3. **Doc tests**:
   - All public APIs must have working examples
   - Examples should be realistic and demonstrate best practices

### Writing Good Tests

```rust
#[test]
fn test_descriptive_name() {
    // Arrange - Set up test data
    let mut sc = ServiceCollection::new();
    sc.add_singleton(42usize);
    
    // Act - Perform the operation
    let sp = sc.build();
    let result = sp.get::<usize>();
    
    // Assert - Verify the outcome
    assert!(result.is_ok());
    assert_eq!(*result.unwrap(), 42);
}
```

### Test Coverage

- Maintain >90% code coverage
- All public APIs must be tested
- Error paths and edge cases must be covered
- Performance-critical paths should have benchmarks

## Code Style

### Formatting

- Use `cargo fmt` for consistent formatting
- Line length: 100 characters (configured in `rustfmt.toml`)
- Use trailing commas in multi-line constructs

### Naming Conventions

- `snake_case` for functions, variables, modules
- `PascalCase` for types, traits, enums
- `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
- Descriptive names over abbreviations

### Documentation

- All public APIs must have doc comments
- Include examples for non-trivial APIs:
  ```rust
  /// Resolves a service of type T from the container.
  ///
  /// # Examples
  ///
  /// ```rust
  /// # use ferrous_di::*;
  /// let mut services = ServiceCollection::new();
  /// services.add_singleton(42usize);
  /// 
  /// let provider = services.build();
  /// let number = provider.get_required::<usize>();
  /// assert_eq!(*number, 42);
  /// ```
  pub fn get<T>(&self) -> DiResult<Arc<T>> { ... }
  ```

## Architecture Guidelines

### Module Organization

- Keep modules focused and cohesive
- Prefer smaller, well-defined modules over large ones
- Use `pub(crate)` for internal APIs
- Document module purpose at the top of each file

### Error Handling

- Use `DiResult<T>` for all fallible operations
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Include context in error variants:
  ```rust
  return Err(DiError::NotFound {
      type_name: std::any::type_name::<T>(),
      context: "singleton resolution",
  });
  ```

### Performance

- Minimize allocations in hot paths
- Use `Arc<T>` for shared ownership
- Prefer lock-free operations where possible
- Profile before and after performance changes

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Ensure all CI checks pass locally**
2. **Update CHANGELOG.md** following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)
3. **Update version** in `Cargo.toml` if needed (for maintainers)
4. **Write a clear PR description** explaining:
   - What problem does this solve?
   - How does it solve it?
   - Any breaking changes?
   - Performance impact?
