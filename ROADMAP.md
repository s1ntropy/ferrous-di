# Ferrous DI - Gold Standard Repository Roadmap

This document outlines the plan to elevate ferrous-di to a gold standard Rust repository with excellent code organization, tooling, and community infrastructure.

## Phase 1: Code Organization & Refactoring 🏗️
**Goal:** Transform monolithic lib.rs into well-organized modules

### Module Structure
```
src/
├── lib.rs              # Public API exports only
├── error.rs            # DiError and Result types
├── lifetime.rs         # Lifetime enum
├── key.rs              # Key enum and related logic
├── registration.rs     # Registration struct
├── collection/
│   ├── mod.rs          # ServiceCollection implementation
│   ├── builder.rs      # Builder pattern for ServiceCollection
│   └── descriptors.rs  # ServiceDescriptor functionality
├── provider/
│   ├── mod.rs          # ServiceProvider implementation
│   ├── resolver.rs     # Resolver and ResolverContext
│   └── scope.rs        # Scope and ScopedResolver
├── options/
│   ├── mod.rs          # Options<T> and IOptions trait
│   └── builder.rs      # OptionsBuilder implementation
└── traits/
    ├── mod.rs          # Trait exports
    ├── dispose.rs      # Dispose and AsyncDispose traits
    └── resolver.rs     # Resolver trait
```

### Refactoring Steps
- [ ] Create module structure
- [ ] Extract error types to error.rs
- [ ] Move Key logic to key.rs
- [ ] Extract ServiceCollection to collection module
- [ ] Extract ServiceProvider to provider module
- [ ] Extract Options pattern to options module
- [ ] Move traits to traits module
- [ ] Update all imports and exports
- [ ] Ensure all tests still pass

## Phase 2: CI/CD Infrastructure 🚀
**Goal:** Automated testing, building, and deployment

### GitHub Actions Workflows
- [ ] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Test matrix (stable, beta, nightly)
- [ ] `.github/workflows/coverage.yml` - Code coverage with tarpaulin
- [ ] `.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml` - Performance regression detection
- [ ] `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Automated publishing
- [ ] `.github/workflows/audit.yml` - Security and license scanning

### CI Configuration
```yaml
# Test on multiple Rust versions and OS
matrix:
  rust: [stable, beta, nightly]
  os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
```

## Phase 3: Documentation Enhancement 📚
**Goal:** Comprehensive documentation for all audiences

## Phase 4: Development Tools 🔧
**Goal:** Consistent code quality and developer experience

### Configuration Files
- [ ] `rustfmt.toml` - Code formatting rules
- [ ] `clippy.toml` - Linting configuration
- [ ] `.editorconfig` - Editor consistency
- [ ] `deny.toml` - Dependency auditing rules
- [ ] `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Git hooks

### Tool Configuration
```toml
# rustfmt.toml
edition = "2021"
max_width = 100
use_small_heuristics = "Max"
imports_granularity = "Module"

# clippy.toml
avoid-breaking-exported-api = true
msrv = "1.70.0"
```

## Phase 5: Testing Improvements 🧪
**Goal:** Comprehensive test coverage with multiple strategies

### Testing Enhancements
- [ ] Add property-based tests with proptest
- [ ] Add fuzzing with cargo-fuzz
- [ ] Create integration test suite

### Test Organization
```
tests/
├── integration/
│   ├── full_application.rs
│   ├── concurrent_access.rs
│   └── memory_leaks.rs
├── property/
│   ├── registration_props.rs
│   └── resolution_props.rs
└── benchmarks/
    └── regression.rs
```

## Phase 6: API Polish 🎯
**Goal:** Ergonomic and powerful API

### API Improvements
- [ ] Derive macros for common patterns
- [ ] Builder pattern for ServiceCollection
- [ ] Extension traits for common use cases
- [ ] Feature flags for optional functionality
- [ ] Consider no_std support

### Feature Flags
```toml
[features]
default = ["std"]
std = []
